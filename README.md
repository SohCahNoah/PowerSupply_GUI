Project: DC-to-DC Power Supply with GUI interface

Steps to operate:
1. Connect the Arduino Uno to the host computer
2. Upload the firmware to the Arduino
3. Ensure that the correct pins are connected to the system for I2C communication (SDK, SDA, 5V VCC, GND)
4. Close any active Serial communications with the Arduino (such as in the Arduino IDE)
5. Run the Python Code
